<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/" target="_blank">/r/fitness</a>
is one subreddit I like a lot on Reddit. I personally think fitness
is something that many people still neglect. Me personally,
I think that a balance of lifting, diet, and personal habits go a long
way towards living a good life.

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/" target="_blank">/r/AskAnAmerican</a>
is another subreddit I like, simply because it's nice to look at other people's
perspectives on American life. Good laughs, and also surprisingly educational.
