<h3>
Life Style Things
</h3>

<p>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/" target="_blank">/r/fitness</a>
is one subreddit I like a lot on Reddit. I personally think fitness
is something that many people still neglect. Me personally,
I think that a balance of lifting, diet, and personal habits go a long
way towards living a good life.

<p>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/" target="_blank">/r/AskAnAmerican</a>
is another subreddit I like, simply because it's nice to look at other people's
perspectives on American life. Good laughs, and also surprisingly educational.

<h3>
Leisure and Hobby Things
</h3>

<p>
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT7njg__VOy3n-SvXemDHvg" target="_blank">Core-A
  Gaming</a>
is a YouTube channel that I watch a lot, because I enjoy fighting games like
Super Smash Bros. and Street Fighter. They explain
certain fighting game concepts very well, like "footsies" and "frame trapping" etc.
It's fun to listen to, even if you don't know much about fighting games.

<h3>
Educational Things
</h3>
<p>
- <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stack overflow</a>
is quite possible one of the greatest things mankind has created aside from Reddit,
although saying that may indicate I go on Reddit way too much. The holy grail of
 general questions and answers for coding, I would be very surprised if you haven't heard
 of this website if you're looking at my website. Either way, if you start coding,
 this will probably be the website you'll go to many many times.
