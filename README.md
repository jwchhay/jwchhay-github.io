# jwchhay.github.io

This is my website repository, where I'll be adding various things like projects, links, etc.

Feel free to look at what I've created.

The folders contain the following:
 - Pictures      -> holds images that act as thumbnails on my website (jwchhay.github.io)
 - Project_Code  -> holds R code that I use to create my little projects
 - Projects      -> holds the individual HTML pages for my R code (uses RMarkdown)
      N.B. *Looking at the contents of the Projects folder is not pleasant because it's all the code that was created by RStudio to create the project pages.*

The files contain the following:
 - README.md     -> readme file.
 - index.html    -> the home page of my website
 - links.html    -> a page that contains various websites I like to frequent
 - projects.html -> a page where I host links to my projects I've done
 - w3.css        -> the overall look and design of the website
