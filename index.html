<h4>
Basic information about me (last updated 1/13/2020):
</h4>

<p>
I am an undergraduate student at UCLA, and I am in my third year as a Statistics major.
I am also currently pursuing a minor in Linguistics. I will graduate by June 2021 (unless some serious diversions
get thrown into my path, which I hope doesn't come anytime soon). Through specfic statistics classes and personal projects, I
aim to pursue data analysis as a career for my future.

<h4>
The goal of this website (last updated 1/13/2020):
</h4>

<p>
I see two major goals with this website:
<ul>
  <li> To showcase analysis skills that I've learned </li>
  <li> To mix personal interests with analysis to provide intriguing results </li>
</ul>
For the first point, this website will serve as an online portfolio.
For the second point, a little anecdote: <br>
A favorite pasttime (or perhaps a waste of time? Erm...) is going on Reddit, and some subreddits I frequent have users create
some visualization projects.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/" target="_blank">/r/dataisbeautiful</a>
is the epitome of this, and the visualizations they create are just awesome to look
at. I think that emulating, and eventually creating my own visualizations, is something that I look forward to doing once I start
mastering data manipulation.
</p>

<h4>
How this website works:
</h4>

<p>
I plan on having links to projects I'll be working on, as well as just various links I frequent a lot (as I plan on having this website
as my main home page).
