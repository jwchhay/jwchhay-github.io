<h4>
About me:
</h4>

<p>
If you're wondering about who I am, I am a 3rd year Statistics student who is also currently pursuing a minor in Linguistics.
I'll graduate from UCLA in Spring 2021. Through specfic statistics classes and personal projects, I
hope to become proficient at analysis, and eventually becoming a data analyst.
</p>

<h4>
The goal of this website:
</h4>

<p>
I see two major goals with this website:
<ul>
  <li> To showcase analysis skills that I've learned </li>
  <li> To mix personal interests with analysis to provide intriguing results </li>
</ul>
For the first point, this website serves as an online portfolio. <br>
For the second point, I like the idea  being able to apply concepts
to things I've learned either from class or from online to hobbies I enjoy.
For example, what if I wanted to see if the speed of a tennis ball serve is related
to the temperature on the moon? I'm not sure if anyone on Earth would be thinking of a question like that,
but it's interesting to see if there is indeed relationships between things that people
don't tend to compare. If anything, we may discover a new trend that could help the world.

<h4>
How this website works:
</h4>

<p>
I plan on having links to projects I'll be working on. Also, I'll have some links
for readings I like.
